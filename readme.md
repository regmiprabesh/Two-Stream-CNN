# Here we use Temporal Stream for Optical Flow and Spatial Stream for RGB Frames 
1. Download UCF-101 Dataset and place it inside Dataset before start training.
2. To start Training run `Video Classification With Two Stream` jupyter notebook file
3. You can directly download the pre-trained model from
